# Motion axis
Given a rotation matrix and a translation vector we have to find the following:
- the motion axes (a_0 and a_1) for certain motions
- the rotation axis
- the generators of a plane which are perpendicular to the motion axes
- point P (point where a_1 intersects the plane)
- point P' (rotation of point P by R matrix)
- point P'' (translation of P' along o'_B vector)
