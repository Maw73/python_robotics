# Coordinate transformation
The task studies the effect of motion (rotation and translation) on a rigid body.

Having a rotation matrix and a translation in B' basis we will:
- Find the coordinates of B in B' and of B' in B bases
- Plot the coordinate systems for (O,B) and (O',B')
- Plot the bound vector x_B
- Plot the position vector (knowing its coordinates): y_B'
- Plot Z (the required motion applied on X will give us Z)
